### Hi there 👋

- I'm Aaron, a cyber security operations analyst at [Monzo Bank](https://github.com/monzo).
- 🌴 In my free time, I like to get stuck into various open source projects that I find useful.
- 🏡 As [Home Assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant/core) is one of the projects I use the most, many of my contributions are to addons or integrations for that.
